# Note: #
This is a slightly modified fork of [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital?tab=readme-ov-file). 

The only change I made was to customize the TCP interface to allow read/write to the RAMDualPort chip of a running simulator. 

I may generalize this feature in the future, but for now it is just a "hack" to allow me to build demo applications that run and read output from this simulated [CPU](https://github.com/rtfmtom/CPU).

Please see the original maintainer's repo for installation instructions, etc.
